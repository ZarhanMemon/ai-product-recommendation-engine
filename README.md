 
# 🛒 E-Commerce Product Recommendation System (Enhanced Version)

A **Flask-based product recommendation system** that analyzes user purchase history from CSV files and recommends relevant products based on **category preferences, brand affinity, discounts, popularity, and similarity scoring**.

This project is designed to be **simple, explainable, and demo-ready**, suitable for:

- Mini-project / AI-ML integration demo  
- Backend recommendation logic showcase  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms need to recommend products that match a user's interests while also considering **brand loyalty, product popularity, and discounts**.

In this project, we:

1. Analyze **past user orders** stored in a CSV file  
2. Identify the user’s **interest patterns** (categories, brands, frequency, recency)  
3. Recommend **new products** from another CSV file  
4. Compute a **hybrid similarity score** (category + brand + popularity + discount)  
5. Display results in a **web dashboard** using Flask + Jinja2  

All data is handled **offline using CSV files** (no database required).

## 🧠 How the System Works (High Level)

```
User selects Customer ID
        ↓
System reads users_order.csv
        ↓
Finds dominant categories, brands & purchase behavior
        ↓
Matches with all_products.csv
        ↓
Computes hybrid similarity score
        ↓
Displays recommendations with explainability
```

## 📊 Dataset Description

### 1️⃣ users_order.csv (User Purchase History)

Each row represents **one product purchase** by a user.

**Columns:**
- `customer_id` – Unique user ID  
- `product_id` – Product identifier  
- `product_name` – Name of product  
- `product_category` – Category (Electronics, Fashion, etc.)  
- `quantity` – Quantity purchased  
- `price_usd` – Price per unit  
- `payment_method` – Credit Card / Debit Card / Paypal / UPI  
- `order_date` – Purchase date  
- `total_amount` – Final order value  

✔ Users can purchase **multiple categories and brands** over time  

---

### 2️⃣ all_products.csv (Product Catalog)

Contains **all available products** on the platform.

**Columns:**
- `product_id`  
- `product_name`  
- `product_category`  
- `price`  
- `discount_price`  
- `stock_quantity`  
- `image_url` (public real image URLs)  
- `brand`  
- `rating` (1–5 stars)  
- `reviews_count` (number of reviews)  

---

## 🤖 Recommendation Logic (Core Idea)

The system uses a **hybrid content-based filtering approach**:

### 🔹 Step 1: User Profiling
- Count category-wise purchases  
- Identify dominant brands & categories  
- Consider quantity and recency  

### 🔹 Step 2: Product Matching
- Recommend products from:  
  * Frequently bought categories  
  * Same brands or related brands  
- Exclude already purchased products  

### 🔹 Step 3: Hybrid Similarity Score
Each recommended product gets a score based on:

- Category match (cosine similarity)  
- Brand affinity  
- Popularity (rating + reviews)  
- Discount attractiveness  
- Recency bonus  

Example:

```
Final Score = 0.5 * Category Similarity
            + 0.2 * Popularity
            + 0.2 * Discount
            + 0.1 * Diversity Factor
```

This score is shown in the UI for **explainability**.

## 🖥️ Web Application Flow

1️⃣ User selects **Customer ID** from dropdown  

2️⃣ System shows:  
- Previously purchased products  
- Recommended products  

3️⃣ Recommendation cards include:  
- Product image  
- Name, category, brand  
- Price (with discount)  
- Rating & reviews  
- Similarity score badge

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **Flask** – Backend web framework  
- **Pandas** – Data processing  
- **Scikit-learn** – Cosine similarity  
- **Jinja2** – HTML templating  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Frontend styling  
- **CSV Files** – Data storage  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
python app.py
```

Then open:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
